# Dino Edu: A Childrens Colour book

###Project submission for the Hack For Africa: A Microsoft Challenge 2020 Hackathon 

##Task
Develop a solution that addresses one or more of the below challenges. We are not telling you what to do, we want you to illustrate your ideas in a way you see fit. Whether that comes from building an app, developing a hardware prototype, or creating a presentation - it is your choice!

##Criteria
Develop an application that addresses one of the following challenges children in Sub-Saharan Africa experience: 
      1. Literacy & Education - how can technology be implemented to decrease the current literacy rate in Africa from 65%.
      2. Health/COVID-19 - how can technology help combat the active cases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and COVID-19 in Africa. 
      3. Other - any other impactful innovation creation that uplifts the present generation of youth in Africa for a brighter future. 
 
##Summary of Tech Stack
This website was built out of the backbone structure of any contemporary website: HTML. As a student developer and graphic design enthusiast HTML was one of the first languages I learnt at school and wanted to use this incredible opportunity to put my knowledge to the test. HTML is a markup language therefore it compiles code into symbols and visual imagery on the internet console at large. I also used CSS to further enhance the user interface of my website tailoring fonts, colours and layouts that appeal to the theme of Dinosaurs at large. Furthermore, JavaScript was employed to make the website come to life and interact with the user as they scroll through the colour book. Javascript enabled me to code "back" and "forth" movements on 2D buttons enabling swift navigation through the website as a whole. In the end, I also experimented with trinket.io, which is a coding platform that enables you to write clean and concise code on any browser and any device. Trinket.io has built-in tutorials to learn Python 3.0 which I took advantage of and used to create the interactive colour pad piece of the website. 

##Functionality
"An arts education helps build academic skills and increase academic performance, while also providing alternative opportunities to reward the skills of children who learn differently" - Gavin Newsom. The arts are not simply a therapeutic endeavour one partakes during their leisure time however an efficient means of not only enhancing the engagement of children in the class curriculum but reducing the emotional side effects of horrific diseases. In the developing African continent, literacy proficiency is a necessity, as is clean resources to obtain food reducing preventable diseases, however, the language of the arts has no barriers in communicating the universal emotions of pain and pleasure. The nonmedical healing of the arts is not as costly as surgical procedures yet ensure a proficient and stable recovery of oneself. This is the very goal of Dino Edu. The HTML website code with CSS and Javascript gives young children the same pleasure of colouring as they with authentic colour pencils, and a little bit of hope for a more vibrant colourful and tidy tomorrow. They are to simply click on a colour box that impersonates a traditional colour pencil and then click on a pixel of the colour grid. Three Nintendo characters have been embedded in the pad which the young creative artist can colour into. 

##Design
I created my design completely from scratch on a blank template from Canva. I used a mix of inbuilt components available from the elements folder and other images I downloaded off of different websites. I wanted the colour scheme and theme to connect to my submission category of "Literacy & Education" so I coloured the background of my colour book yellow which adorns the flag of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa such as Ghana, Congo and Ethiopia. An image of a well-loved Nintendo character Yoshi the dinosaur was also added about the Mokele-mbembe water entity in the Congo River Basin. All in all my design was minimalistic, vibrant and fun!
