##Summary of Tech Stack

##Functionality
"An arts education helps build academic skills and increase academic performance, while also providing alternative opportunities to reward the skills of children who learn differently" - Gavin Newsom. The arts are not simply a therapeutic endeavour one partakes during their leisure time however an efficient means of not only enhancing the engagement of children in the class curriculum but reducing the emotional side effects of horrific diseases. In the developing African continent, literacy proficiency is a necessity, as is clean resources to obtain food reducing preventable diseases, however, the language of the arts has no barriers in communicating the universal emotions of pain and pleasure. The nonmedical healing of the arts is not as costly as surgical procedures yet ensure a proficient and stable recovery of oneself. This is the very goal of Dino Edu. The HTML website code with CSS and Javascript gives young children the same pleasure of colouring as they with authentic colour pencils, and a little bit of hope for a more vibrant colourful and tidy tomorrow. They are to simply click on a colour box that impersonates a traditional colour pencil and then click on a pixel of the colour grid. Three Nintendo characters have been embedded in the pad which the young creative artist can colour into.
